# Pearson-TSA-Training-Beginner

# Overview

Time series forecasting is both a fascinating subject to study and an important technique applied in industry, government, and academic settings. Example applications include demand and inventory planning, marketing strategy planning, capital budgeting, pricing, machine predictive maintenance, and macroeconomic forecasting, just to name a few. Forecasting typically requires time series data, and time series data is ubiquitous nowadays, both within and outside of the data science field, such as weekly initial unemployment claims, tick-level stock prices, weekly company sales, daily number of steps taken recorded by a wearable, machine performance measurements recorded by sensors, and key performance indicators of business functions. 
 
This training provides an introduction to time series analysis and forecasting, covering the key differences between time series data and cross-sectional data, manipulation of time series data, exploratory time series data analysis using statistics (and their graphical representations), and one of the most important classes of statistical time series models; AutoRegression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and its Seasonal counterpart (SARIMA) with and without explanatory variables. As some of the most important and commonly used data science techniques to analyze time series data and make forecasts based on those developed in the field of statistics and machine learning, this introductory time series training provides the practical foundations for conducting time series analysis and forecasting.

# Learning Objectives

The attendees will learn the following concepts and techniques in this training course:

      * Mathematical formulation of this class of model
      * Statistical assumptions of this class of model
      * Implementation of these models in Python using simulated and real-world time-series data
      * ARIMA model selection
      * Assumption testing and model evaluation
